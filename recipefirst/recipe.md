INGREDIENTS
 
75 g self raising flour
125 g icing sugar
40 g cocoa powder – 9 tbsp
70 ml sunflower oil
20 g dark chocolate

INSTRUCTIONS
 
Preheat oven to 200 C fan
To start, grease 4 x 5oz ramekins ( or any similar size oven proof cup, approx 7- 8 cm wide, 4.5 cm high) . It is important to grease the ramekins/cup very well or the cake will be difficult to unmold,we used softened vegan butter to grease our ramekins. Next flour the greased ramekin, add a couple of tablespoons of flour to each ramekin/cup and roll it on its side so the flour coats all the butter, knocking out any excess flour into a bowl and giving a final knock upside down to remove the flour (this makes sure the cake does not have a chalky appearance when unmolded). Place the ramekins/cups on a baking tray.
Roughly chop the chocolate into small pieces or you can use dark chocolate drops.
Sieve the dry ingredients with a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl, and mix so everything is combined. In a separate jug mix the 70ml of sunflower oil with 100ml of water and mix well. Make a well in the dry ingredients, add the wet and mix using a spatula or spoon until well combined and you have a nice shiny loose batter. Divide the batter between the ramekins evenly.
Add roughly a ¼ of the chocolate or 5g to the centre of the batter in each cup. And press down with a small spoon so it is just submerged in the batter, taking care not to press it all the way down to the bottom.
Bake in the preheated oven for 12 mins at 200 C fan. It is important not to over cook the cakes or the liquid centre will cook through.
Remove from the oven. Leave to sit for 1 minute, using a butter knife, run it gently around the rim to loosen from the ramekin, then serve as is in the ramekin. Or invert onto a plate or bowl, leave for a few seconds, then carefully remove the hot ramekin using a teatowel. Serve immediately with vegan ice cream or cream.
